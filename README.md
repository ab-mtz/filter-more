This project involves implementing a set of image filtering functions like grayscale, reflection,  blur and edge detection, using C programming.

This was one of the most interesting and exciting projects for me. The challenge of understanding and utilizing the kernel and convolution to alter the image was stimulating. Also, comprehending the logical process to apply the kernel in cases of exclusion such as edges and corners was enlightening.
